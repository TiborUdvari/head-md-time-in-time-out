### Findings

> “Clocks, it is often forgotten, do not keep the time, but a time” (Nanni, 2012, p. 1)

> “The Shepherd gate clock [...] was the first clock ever to show Greenwich Mean Time directly to the public. It is a 'slave' clock, connected to the Shepherd master clock which was installed at the Royal Observatory in 1852.”(What Is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) - and Why Does It Matter?, n.d.)

> By 1866, time signals were also sent from the clock to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts via the new transatlantic submarine cable

It was 24 hours, with hour 0 starting at noon. 

## Questions

* How did GMT become the standard? Could it be elsewhere?
* What is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)? How is it different from GMT? And why is it's acronym incorrect? 
* How do other people measure time?

## Thoughts

There is not one correct time. Convention made it so.

Conventions are political. Time is also.

The time convention doesn't work for everyone, it can be illustrated by extreme cases. (Whyman, n.d.)
