• 0:00 - 0:01 
Okay.

• 0:03 - 0:06 
Okay, cool. Uh, is it okay if we speak in English?

• 0:06 - 0:08 
Yeah, I think it's okay.

• 0:08 - 0:13 
Okay, cool. Thank you. Uh, first of all, for, uh, wearing the percentage of watch.

• 0:14 - 0:16 
No problem. It was a great experience actually.

• 0:16 - 0:18 
What did you think about it?

• 0:18 - 0:54 
Uh, at first it was really like a toy. Like I, I was checking it constantly and, uh, the more the gay the day was, uh, advancing, the shorter the time, uh, remaining was, uh, was, uh, it was stressful. And when I arrived at home and it was like, well, okay, I was feeling super stressed by just this little indication. And, uh, I was train to, how can I say, um, <inaudible>, like, um, uh, make my time worse.

• 0:00 - 0:00 


• 0:55 - 0:56 
Make the most out of your time.

• 0:56 - 1:28 
Yeah, like, uh, uh, when the, when the I'm, the shorter the time remaining was the more I was trying to improve in my activities. And at first it was really a playful, playful thing. Like, uh, at noon it was, uh, just like, uh, checking, uh, the, the speed of the time. And then, uh, it was a catastrophic, like, I was super stressed by the device and I didn't want to look at it.

• 1:29 - 1:45 
And, uh, at, uh, finally I just put it out of my wrist because I didn't want to have it on me at all. And I wanted to check what happened at midnight, like, uh, when it passed a minute to midnight, but I missed it at like three, it was 30 seconds, so, yeah.

• 1:46 - 1:49 
And what did you think, uh, how about the next day? How did you feel?

• 1:50 - 1:53 
Uh, like today? Yes. It had no battery.

• 1:54 - 1:56 
Oh, it went out of, uh, okay, so you couldn't,.

• 1:56 - 2:04 
Like, the morning I wanted to put it out and like leave the, the good part again, but it was out of battery, so I was.

• 2:04 - 2:06 
So you just had a horrible experience,.

• 2:07 - 2:25 
<Laugh>? No, it was, uh, it was good at first, but it was a two part experience and, uh, I wanted to, I think it's a cycle and in the morning it's super great for me, at least in the morning, it's super great till noon, and then it just gets like a run, maybe a race with myself, so, yeah.

• 2:25 - 2:28 
How would you do it differently if you would actually want to use it,.

• 2:30 - 2:32 
Um, as a watch? Use it as a watch.

• 2:33 - 2:35 
Maybe? Yeah. Mm.

• 2:37 - 2:40 
Like what would I add if I want to use it every day?

• 2:42 - 2:46 
That's the question. No, it's just a general question. More like, uh, to provoke, uh,.

• 2:48 - 3:25 
Um, if I used it every day, I think actually it's more clear than a real clock. And it's, uh, I, I think I'm making less excuses to myself when I just see a bar than the time where I can say, okay, maybe in 10 minute I'll do that. Or maybe in five minute I fix myself that I do that. And here I can't just do that. I just see the time that is running. And I think I have a really different relation with time if I don't see it with numbers and it's just a graphic representation, so, yeah.

• 0:00 - 0:00 


• 3:26 - 3:27 
Okay. How, how so?

• 3:28 - 3:28 
Mm,.

• 3:31 - 4:09 
Because, uh, when it's a value with numbers, I think I, I'm meeting, I'm making things up in my head, like a acidification about this hours is supposed to be that this hour is supposed to be another thing or another activity, or, okay, it's not supposed to take me this time to do this. And with the bar, it's just a more contemplative experience. Maybe I'm just like a Okay. Well, the bar has, uh, progressed a little. Okay. And yeah, I think it's, uh, the thing of, uh, less stressful except for the part when it's too full and it's like, oh my God, something is going to happen.

• 4:09 - 4:15 
And in fact, no. But, uh, it's <laugh> maybe the, the loading bar, uh, experiments. I don't know.

• 4:18 - 4:20 
I Do you want to add anything else?

• 4:21 - 4:52 
Um, I think it would've been great to have it on two days actually. Uh, I'm really curious about, uh, what it will have been and if I would've add again, um, this feeling the second day, but I think it's a, I'm supposing it's a cycle, uh, which is not so much the case with a digital clock, but, uh, yeah, it's a new superposition. So that's all I can add for now.

• 4:53 - 4:54 
Yeah,.

• 4:54 - 4:55 
That's it.
