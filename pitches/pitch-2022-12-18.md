# Ciggy Time

"Ciggy Time" is a wrist-based smoking simulator game that is set in a fictional world where the tobacco industry has convinced society that their products are not harmful. Inspired by the Tamagotchi craze of 1996, the game aims to appeal to a wider audience by featuring minimalist interaction with only one button labeled "SMOKE". The watch not only showcases the desires of its creators, but also portrays the mechanics of nicotine addiction.

As the user plays the game, they have total control over their decision to smoke or not. The game serves as a commentary on the absurdity and effort required to be a smoker, as well as the self-deception that smokers often engage in.

Possible alternative names: "Light Up", "Puff, Puff"
